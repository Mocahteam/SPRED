# Properties for the Python AI Interface
#
# NOTE: When specifying relative paths to files (eg. log files),
# be aware that these files will likely end up in springs writable data dir,
# though this is not guaranteed, which means you may have to search for them
# in the CWD of the Python, which differs between platforms.
#
# NOTE: When specifying paths to files (eg. log files),
# you can make use of ${home-dir}, which will be replaced with something like:
# "{abs-path-to-spring-writable-data-dir}/AI/Interfaces/Python/0.1"
#

# Logging related
;log.file=${home-dir}/log/interface-custom-log.txt
# 1 : log only errors
# 10: log everything
;log.level=10
;log.useTimeStamps=false

#set the order, the interface tries to load python
#seperate by space
#remove the semikolon to set it
;python.version=python2.6 python2.7 python2.5 python3.1 python2.4

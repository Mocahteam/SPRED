Welcome to HughAI, by Hugh Perkins 2009

Installation
============

First things first, how to install it?

If you're reading this, you've already downloaded and extracted HughAI.

Now, to complete installation, you simply need to make sure it is 
extracted into Spring's AI/Skirmish directory, so you should have the following
directory structure:

AI/
   Skirmish/
      HughAI/
         0.1/
            SkirmishAI.jar
            ... other files ... 

Note:
- you'll need hoijui's Java Interface v0.1.  This comes by default in
  the Windows and Ubuntu installations.  Check in Spring chat if you're 
  not sure, or with hoijui, or myself, but I'm rarely on line, and 
  I won't know anyway.  hoijui is the man ;-)

How to use?
===========

Start springlobby, create a single player game, select a map, a mod, and click 
"Add bot...", select "HughAI".

You can also use tasclient or your favorite Spring lobby client, as long
as it supports modern Spring AIs (check with hoijui if you're not sure).

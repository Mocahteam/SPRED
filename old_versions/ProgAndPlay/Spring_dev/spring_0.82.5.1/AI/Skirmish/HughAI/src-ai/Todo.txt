New todo
========

high, blocking publication:
- nothing

medium/low, suboptimal:
- losmap needs to support los reservations otherwise scouts go same way
- issue with metal/energy decisions
- workflow stalls occasionally
- add workflow configuration dialog to gui
- add lists to config dialog
- reactivate heightmap file cache
- add workflow to gui
- add battle analysis to gui, using cheating perhaps:
    - total energy, total metal
    - total units, breakdown by unit
    - total "power"

in order to beat e323:
- add pathing
- why does workflow jam?

in order to beat aai:
- make better use of excessive amounts of metal...
  - add workflow status to gui

in order to beat aai, done:
- purge dynamic enemies' pos if they're no longer there...

in order to beat e323, done:
- make enemy targeting threatmap dependent 
- make attacks threatmaap dependent, rather than purely >=5 tanks dependent
- make scouts target anything, not just metal extractors and solarcells, though
  maybe make those priority

low:
- make config dialog easier to read somehow, group stuff together?
- add 'reset config to defaults' button
- add 'needs to be arm' to welcome messages

suspended:
- speed up getheighttmap somehow?  replicate spring's internal getelevation algo?
   - we need basically an addition to the Java AI Interface v0.1, in order to 
     obtain the corner map heights

usability:
- add parameters to welcome message, like %configfilepath, %workflowdirectory
  %modname
- make gui non-default, so works full-screen and / or detect full-screen
  and disactivate it
  - checked on ubuntu: it just switches to non fullscreen automatically
    - still, there is some issue it seems, to be monitored

done:
- added exceptions dialog to gui
- migrated logging to use java.util.logging classes
- make enemy targeting by scoutcontrollers threatmap dependent 
- add ecma console for imbaczek
- add console
- add threatmap
- make decently typed Float3 classes, like terrainpos, metalpos, threatmappos etc
- add cheating option
- add config dialog to gui
- test cheating works with java interface 0.1 -> done, ok, can see enemy units ok.
- add default workflow name to config
- add welcome messages:
   - supported mod (Basic Annihilation)
   - how to enter debug mode
   - config file
   - (gui mode)
   - workflow configuration
- move buildEconomy workflow stuff into xml files
- enemytracker needs to track mobile units too, otherwise tankcontroller doesn't work
- issue with movementareaas for search etc

abandoned:
- get hold of valid startscript, or latest springlobby -> just use 0.80.4
- add mod name + version to name of buildtable cachefile => there isn't a buildtable
  cache, so it's irrelevant ;-)

to communicate:
- nice to have a function getCornerHeightMap, which returns the corner heights
  of each mapsquare, rather than the center heights
- or... a way of getting the mapfilename, and loading the map image directly
  from the map file
- get rid of debug and logging in java interface
- Java AI in spring from git very slow!
- getPos() to return null if not in los

to communicate, done:
- exact command to get linedrawer crash
- command to crash spring, when too many lines are drawn
- performance of getDef() and getPos()

- crash with line drawer / how to draw lines that only last a few seconds? 
   or how  to draw lines and then delete them a few seconds later? or
   how to remove all lines on the map?

High level methods:
- take a group of units, say to someone "attack the enemy with these"
- take a group of units, say to someone "attack here with this"
- take a list of unit types, say to someone "attack the enemy with these types"
- take a list of unit types, say to someoen "scout the enemy with these"
- say to someone "attack the enemy, build what you need, request through me".
   - have a priority, or a percentage allocation, or a total allocation, for this

Legacy todo
===========

Short
- scout in front of tanks and lugers
- put tanks and lugers into formation
- two or three packs??? fast small units for base, large units + small units for assault???
- do area analysis "this is enemy base", "this is friendly base"
- air scouting???
- improve initial scouting
- antinuke
- add defense (guardians etc)
- add radar
- group sizes increase (with time?)

Medium
- add more workflow plans


Done:

Interface:
- add map point

Short
- prevent factories jamming

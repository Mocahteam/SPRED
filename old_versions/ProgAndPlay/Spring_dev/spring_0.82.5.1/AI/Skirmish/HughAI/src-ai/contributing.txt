Contributing to HughAI
======================

You are more than welcome to just fork the whole thing and play as you like.

Whenever you like, you can submit a patch file to me for stuff you want back in this version
and I'll try to merge your changes back in.

Please keep my copyright notices everywhere where they exist already in existing
files.

Please feel free to add your own name into the copyright  notice - without getting
rid of mine! - maybe with some sort of history in the file

If you fork this, I'd appreciate it if you give me some credit in the credits
of your new AI.  There is no legal obligation to do this, but I'd
appreciate it!  And then I'll be more motivated to add in new features, bug fixes
 and so on that you can use in your own new forked AI :-)

If you want to submit a patch, please try to either be consistent with the
existing architecture where it exists, or consider how we can improve the
architecture where it is flaky.

Generally, the concept in the architecture is to try to layer things, for example
there are several layers of controllers, and we'll gradually add in more
layers of mapping, along similar lines.

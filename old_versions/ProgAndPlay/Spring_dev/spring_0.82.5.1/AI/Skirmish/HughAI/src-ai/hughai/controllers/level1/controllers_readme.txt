These are the second level of control.

something high-level (workflow) can say to the controllers something like:
preferably, something highlevel:
- "attack the enemy, build what you need, request through me".
   - the higher-level will have a priority, or a percentage allocation,
     or a total allocation, for deciding which units to build as the
     requests come in

lowerlevel, not so good, these orders should be handled by lower level preferably,
  and given by a controller:
- take this group of units, "attack the enemy with these"
- take this group of units, "attack here with this"
- take this list of unit types, "attack the enemy with these, you own all the units of these types"
- take this list of unit types, say to someoen "scout the enemy with these, you own all the units of these types"

In other words, this package should be more at a "strategic" level, and
packcoordinators and so on are more at a "tactical" level, and there might
be something in between
